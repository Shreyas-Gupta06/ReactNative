1) _Step Tracker_ is a React Native app that helps you track your daily steps, distance, calories burned, and walking time. Steps and goals are stored locally on your device, keeping your data private and offlineâ€”no account needed. The app calculates distance, calories, and time based on your steps, and lets you set custom step goals and reset your progress. Push notifications alert you when you reach your goal.

  In addition to daily tracking, the app features a Step History page where you can view your stats for the past 7 days, including steps,   distance, and calories for each day, all displayed in a clear and interactive chart. This gives you a complete overview of your recent    activity and progress.
